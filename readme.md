# Chatbot with RAG and LangChain 

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** using **LangChain**, **ChromaDB**, and **Sentence-Transformers** for local embeddings.  
It allows you to upload PDF documents, build a vector database, and interact with the content using a conversational interface built on **Gradio**.

## Features

- Splits documents into context-aware chunks for efficient retrieval.
- Provides a **Gradio UI** for seamless chat interactions.
- Fully offline and privacy-preserving (no external API calls).
